1.1.0:
- add chat prefixes to plugin chat messages
- fix issues where ready-up checking timers were being created multiple teams (as a result some chat messages were printed multiple times)
- add an (optional) fun command ``sm_name`` that lets you pick a name/flag for a player, when the game goes live it selects a random team/flag from the players on the team to use
