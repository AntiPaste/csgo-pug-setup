csgo-pug-setup
===========================

This is a useful plugin for managing pug games or 10 mans. It allows a player to type .setup into chat and select (from a menu):
  - how to choose the teams (players do it manually, random teams, captains select teams)
  - how to choose the map (use the current map, do a map vote using maps from addons/sourcemod/configs/pugselect/maps.txt)

Some commands that are important are:
- .setup, begins the setup phase and sets the pug "owner"
- .start, begins the game (note that the cvar sm_teamselect_autolo3 controls if this is needed for non-manual team selections)
- .rand (only the owner can do this)
- .endgame, force ends the game safely (only the owner can do this)
- .pause (only owners and captains can do this)
- .unpause (only owners and captains can do this)

The chat commands are mostly aliases for sourcemod admin commands, so an admin can override things if needed.

These use admin flag "g" for map change abilities:
- sm_setup
- sm_start
- sm_capt1 <player>
- sm_capt2 <player>
- sm_endgame (note this resets the owner to none, so you can take ownership this way)

These use the generic admin flag "b":
- sm_pause
- sm_unpause

ConVars:
- they are autogenerated and put in cfg/sourcemod/teamselect.cfg
