csgo-pug-setup
===========================

This is a useful plugin for managing pug games or 10 mans. It allows a player to type .setup into chat and select (from a menu):
- how to choose the teams (players do it manually, random teams, captains select teams)
- how to choose the map (use the current map, do a map vote using maps from addons/sourcemod/configs/pugselect/maps.txt)

### Download
You should be able to get the most recent **pugsetup.zip** file from https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup/releases.

### Installation
Download pugsetup.zip and extract the files to the game server. You should have installed:
- csgo/addons/sourcemod/configs/maps.txt **(you might want to edit this!)**
- csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins/pugsetup.smx
- csgo/cfg/sourcemod/pugsetup/warmup.cfg **(you might want to edit this)**
- csgo/cfg/sourcemod/pugsetup/standard.cfg **(you might want to edit this)**

Note that the maps.txt file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist and the names of the cfg files executed can be changed by convars. For example, you could set sm_pugsetup_live_cfg to cevo.cfg to run the CEVO config instead of the one I provide. See the ConVars section for details.


### Commands
Some commands that are important are:
- **.setup**, begins the setup phase and sets the pug "owner"
- **.start**, begins the game (note that the cvar sm_teamselect_autolo3 controls if this is needed for non-manual team selections)
- **.ready**
- **.unready**
- **.pause**
- **.unpause**
- .rand (only the pug owner can do this)
- .endgame, force ends the game safely (only the owner can do this)

The chat commands are mostly aliases for sourcemod admin commands, so an admin can override things if needed. The bold commands are only avaliable through these admin commands and have no chat aliases (other than the default sourcemod ones, e.g. !owner or /owner go with sm_owner)

These use admin flag "g" for map change abilities:
- **sm_owner** playername (allows you to set the pug owner)
- **sm_capt1** playername (sets captain #1)
- **sm_capt2** playername (sets captain #2)
- sm_setup
- sm_start
- sm_rand
- sm_endgame (note this resets the owner to none)
These use the generic admin flag "b":
- sm_pause
- sm_unpause

Generally you don't need the admin (sm_) commands, but they may come in helpful if a captain/owner doesn't know about the .pause feature or
you need to take ownership of the pug.

### Convars
These are put in an autogenerated file at **cfg/sourcemod/pugsetup.cfg** :
- **sm_pugsetup_warmup_cfg** should store where the warmup config goes, defaults to the included file **sourcemod/pugsetup/warmup.cfg**)
- **sm_pugsetup_live_cfg** should store where the warmup config goes, defaults to the included file **sourcemod/pugsetup/standard.cfg**
- **sm_pugsetup_autolo3** controls if a .start (or !start) is needed for going live in a 10man/random team game, default is **1**
- **sm_pugsetup_numplayers** controls the minimum number of players to go live (default is **10**)
- **sm_pugsetup_autorecord** controls if the plugin should autorecord a gotv demo (you may need to add some extra cvars to your cfgs, such as tv_enable 1), the default is **1**
