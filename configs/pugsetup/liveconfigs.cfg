// The name->file entries in this file allow choosing between live configs.
// When more than 2 entires are present here, an option on the setup
// menu will appear to choose between these settings.
// When one is chosen, the sm_pugsetup_live_cfg cvar  will be set to the file.
// Note: All file paths are relative to the cfg directory.
// For example: you might add the following here:
//
//	"CEVO"		"cevo.cfg"
//	"ESL5on5"		"esl5on5.cfg"
//
// If you don't want to name configs, you can leave that part blank and use the
// file as the name, for example:
//
//	"esl2on2.cfg"		""
//
// And this will work as expected with esl2on2.cfg as the config name and the file path.
//
// Remember: these are examples, only the default sourcemod/pugsetup/live.cfg is actually
// included - you would need to get the cevo/esl/etc. configs from their websites to use them.
