// You can fully customize the keys in this file with any chat alias you want.
// You are not limited to the .command style, you could do any chat prefix you wish.
// These all take the form of chat alias -> command.
// Furthermore, duplicate aliases for the same command are fine.
//
// Note: sometimes chat alias commands will be printed to chat to users,
// for example, when telling a client how to ready up. These commands
// will be read from the "bottom" of this file first - so you should
// add a standard command (like .ready -> sm_ready) to the end of the file,
// and do "fun" ones (like .gaben -> sm_ready) to the front of the file.
